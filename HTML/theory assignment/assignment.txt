 Q1. Explain the structure of an HTML document and the purpose of DOCTYPE.

    Structure of an HTML Document
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My Web Page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
        </body>
        </html>

    Explanation of Each Part:
        <!DOCTYPE html>
            Declares the document type (HTML5).
            It tells the browser to render the page using the latest standard.
        <html lang="en">
            Root element of the HTML document.
            lang="en" specifies that the language is English.
        <head>
            Contains meta-information about the document (not visible on the page).
            Includes things like:
                <meta charset="UTF-8"> → character encoding.
                <meta name="viewport"> → responsiveness for mobile devices.
                <title> → page title shown on the browser tab.
                Links to stylesheets, scripts, and favicons.
        <body>
            Contains all the visible content: headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.
            This is what the user sees and interacts with.

    Purpose of <!DOCTYPE>
        It stands for Document Type Declaration.
        <!DOCTYPE html> specifically declares that the page is written in HTML5.
        Helps browsers to render the page correctly using standard mode (not quirks mode, which is for older HTML versions).
        It isn't an HTML tag, just an instruction to the browser.


 Q2. List and explain at least five common HTML tags used in website design.
    1. <div> — Division Container
        Purpose: Acts as a container for grouping HTML elements, commonly used for layout and styling.
        Why it's important: Helps structure sections of a page and apply CSS or JavaScript easily.
            <div class="header">
                <h1>My Website</h1>
            </div>
    2. <h1> to <h6> — Headings
        Purpose: Defines headings; <h1> is the most important, <h6> the least.
        Why it's important: Provides structure and improves accessibility and SEO.
            <h1>Main Title</h1>
            <h2>Subheading</h2>
    3. <p> — Paragraph
        Purpose: Represents a paragraph of text.
        Why it's important: Used for adding readable content, descriptions, and body text.
            <p>This is a paragraph about the website content.</p>
    4. <a> — Anchor (Link)
        Purpose: Creates hyperlinks to other pages, websites, or sections of the same page.
        Why it's important: Enables navigation between pages.
            <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    5. <img> — Image
        Purpose: Embeds an image on the webpage.
        Why it's important: Enhances the visual appeal and user engagement.
            <img src="logo.png" alt="Website Logo">


 Q3. Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML.
     Block-Level Elements
        Block-level elements take up the full width available, and they always start on a new line.
        Common Examples:
            <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>

     Inline Elements
        Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
        Common Examples:
            <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <label>, <input>, <br>
