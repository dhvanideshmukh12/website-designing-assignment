 Theory Assignments

 1. Explain the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS.
    inline css:
        Inline CSS is used to apply styles directly within an HTML element by using the style attribute. It affects only that   specific element.


    internal css:
        Internal CSS is placed within the <style> tag inside the <head> section of an HTML document. It is used for styling a single document and applies to all elements within that document.

    external css:
        External CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to an HTML document using the <link> tag. This approach is ideal for larger websites as styles can be applied across multiple pages.


 2. Describe CSS selectors and list the types of selectors (e.g., element, class, id).
    CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. These selectors help target specific elements to apply styles.
    
    Types of selectors:
        1. Universal Selector
        2. Id Selector
        3. Class Selector
        4. Group Selector
        5. Element Selector
        6. Descendant Selector

 3. Discuss the CSS boxmodel and its components
    The CSS Box Model is a key concept in web design that describes how the dimensions and layout of elements are structured and rendered in a browser. Every HTML element is considered a box, and this box consists of several layers, each contributing to the overall size and spacing of the element.

    Components of the CSS Box Model:
        Content: width, height
        Padding: padding, padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left
        Border: border, border-width, border-style, border-color
        margine: margin, margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left
