 Theory Assignments

 1. Define responsive design and its importance in modern web development.

    Responsive Design is a web design approach that ensures a website automatically adjusts its layout, images, and functionality to fit various screen sizes and devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

    Importance in Modern Web Development:
     -Improved User Experience: Ensures content is readable and accessible on all devices.

     -Mobile Usage Growth: Most users access websites via smartphones, making responsiveness essential.

     -SEO Benefits: Google favors mobile-friendly sites in its search results.

     -Cost Efficiency: A single responsive site is easier to maintain than separate versions for different devices.

     -Consistency Across Devices: Delivers a uniform user interface regardless of device used.


 2. Explain the role of media queries in responsive design.
    Media Queries are CSS rules used to apply styles depending on a deviceâ€™s properties such as screen width, height, resolution, and orientation.

    Purpose and Role:
        -Customize Layouts: Adjusts page styling based on screen size.

        -Flexible Design: Helps modify text size, grid layouts, and image visibility for different devices.

        -Mobile-First Approach: Allows developers to style for small screens first, then expand to larger devices.

    Example Syntax:
        @media (max-width: 768px) {
            body {
                font-size: 14px;
            }
        }

 3. Describe how viewportsettings affect mobile displays.
    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page on a device screen. Mobile browsers often simulate a desktop screen unless told otherwise.

    Viewport Meta Tag:
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    Effect on Mobile Displays:

        -Device-Based Width: Sets the width of the page to match the device's screen.

        -Zoom Control: Controls how the page scales on load (initial-scale=1.0).

        -Responsive Layout Activation: Ensures that media queries and responsive units (%, vw, em) work correctly on mobile devices.
